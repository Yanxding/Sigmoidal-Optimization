Sigmoidal Programming (SP) is a class of non-convex, NP-hard problems relating to maximizing a sum of sigmoidal functions over a convex constraint set. There exist a large number of practical problems which can be modeled as such problems, in domains ranging from economics, marketing to machine learning and network optimization. As SP problems have non-convex objective functions, most traditional optimization techniques cannot be directly applied. This implementation of SP solver is based on the paper "Maximizing a Sum of Sigmoids" by Madeleine Udell and Stephen Boyd (2014).
A \textbf{sigmoidal function} is any Lipshitz continuous function over a finite interval $f \colon [\ell, u] \to \reals$ which is convex over $[\ell, z]$ and concave over $[z, u]$, for some known parameter $z \in [\ell, u]$.
